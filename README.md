Scenario 
Design and implement a transportation system where there are three types of users: 
1. Admin: Manages vehicle data, routes, and schedules. 
2. Drivers: Access and manage their schedules and routes. 
3. Passengers: Book tickets and view schedules. 
File Manager Structure 
• /transportation 
o /admin: Contains administrative files, accessible only by the admin. 
o /drivers: Contains schedules and route information, accessible only by 
respective drivers. 
o /passengers: Contains booking and ticket files for each passenger.

Tasks: 
------
1. List files/directories: 
o Admin, drivers, and passengers can list files in their respective directories. 
2. Change permissions of files/directories: 
o Admin sets permissions for sensitive schedule and route data. 
3. Make/delete files/directories: 
o Admin or drivers can create or remove directories for routes and schedules. 
4. Create symbolic link files: 
o Admin creates symbolic links for common schedules or policy documents. 
5. Copy files/directories: 
o Admin copies route files for archiving. 
o Passengers copy ticket files within their personal directories. 
6. Move files/directories: 
o Drivers reorganize route schedules. 
7. Use redirection to create or update files: 
o Passengers add feedback to their booking using > or >>. 
8. Set and use aliases for common tasks: 
o Admin and drivers create aliases for frequent operations. 
9. View file content using cat, head, and tail: 
o Drivers preview their schedules, and passengers view ticket summaries. 
10. Find files or directories using find or grep: 
o Admin searches for specific route files, and passengers search their tickets.

our Ubuntu task is in main.c
----------
You will implement one of the scheduling algorithms using Any programming Languages like 
(C, C++,Python,Java).   - The number of processes should be user-defined (e.g. user enters them at run time).   - All process data (e.g. process arrival time, burst time, etc.) must be user-defined.  - Validation for the input data must be considered (e.g. user can’t enter negative numbers or 
characters in the input fields).  - Waiting Time, Turnaround Time, and Response Time for each process should be calculated.   - Average Waiting Time, Average Turnaround Time, and Average Response Time should be 
calculated.   
Task 2 ideas: 
----------
 Priority (Preemptive)  
 Task 2 is implemented by C++ in main.cpp file
